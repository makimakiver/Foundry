# FoundryÂ³ Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values

# Sui Blockchain Configuration (Testnet)
# Get these from deploying your Move contract with: cd Foundry && sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000

# Package ID - The ID of your deployed foundry package
VITE_PACKAGE_ID=0xYOUR_PACKAGE_ID_HERE

# Registry ID - The shared Registry object ID from deployment
VITE_REGISTRY_ID=0xYOUR_REGISTRY_ID_HERE

# Foundry ID - Optional: Parent SuiNS NFT for founder subnames
VITE_FOUNDRY_ID=0xYOUR_FOUNDRY_NFT_ID_HERE

# How to get these values:
# 1. Navigate to: cd Foundry
# 2. Build: sui move build
# 3. Publish: sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
# 4. Look for "Created Objects" in the output:
#    - Package ID will have Owner: Immutable, ObjectType: package::Package
#    - Registry ID will have Owner: Shared, ObjectType: foundry::ideation::Registry
# 5. Copy these IDs to your .env file

# Security Notes:
# - Never commit .env to git (it's already in .gitignore)
# - Each developer should have their own .env file
# - For production, use proper secret management
